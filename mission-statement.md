# Mission Statement and Philosophy

**TrustFOSS - A nonprofit organization**

Free/Open Source Software and its communities are provably more trustworthy and secure than closed source, proprietary software and the corporations that produce it.  An advocate is needed to (1) educate the public and further this position, (2) assist in the security and privacy enhancement of all Free/Open Source Software products, and (3) advance the science of evaluating software for privacy and security as well as the practices to create it.

## Motivation

Whether intentionally through backdoor, malware, or malicious contribution, or simply by accident, insecurities find their way into software systems. Already a maze of unknowns, the entire technology stack is rightly in doubt, from the processor microcode and keyboard firmware up through browser plugins to audio drivers.  There are some projects underway focusing on auditing of cryptography products but the entire stack needs to be considered.
